/*
Write the program that will calculate the average grade. Use 5 String variables and 6 double variables to hold the subject and the grade value. Build a summary with all the information by concatenating the subjects and grades. Then calculate the average grade and print display the average score too.

Execution flow with example:

Welcome to the Grader!
Please enter subject name number 1 and score for this subject
Math

Please enter subject name number 4 and score for this subject
Chemistry
4.8
Please enter subject name number 5 and score for this subject
Music

â€‹
Summary: Math - 5.0,  Biology - 4.2,  English - 4.4, Chemistry - 4.8, Music - 3.4
Your average score is: 4.36
